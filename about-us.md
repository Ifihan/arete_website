 Arete,is a non-profit organization based on teaching children how to use Microsoft Office Tools and Scratch for programming. It
 is an initiative birthed by Onuoha Maryann in December, 2019. She shared the idea of having an NGO which teaches 
 primary and secondary school pupils how to use Microsoft Office Tools (MS Word, MS Excel, MS Powerpoint and MS Access) and Scratch
 before they learn how to start coding.
 
 She shared the idea with Abisola Jegede, Olusheye Ifihanagbara and Mbaoma Chioma Mary who felt it was a really
 nice idea and agreed to work towards making it a reality. They reached out to some of their friends and got positive responses from them.
 
 
 Our first engagement was with Lend a Hand for Africa, an NGO which promotes children's education and skill acquisition. 
 We taught twenty-seven (27) children from G-Grace school, Ikorodu for two weeks (2) before the lockdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
 

We believe that teaching and equipping children with soft skills and programming skills will improve their typing, 
critical thinking, and problem-solving abilities and also bridge the technological gap between our society and the global community 
and also help them solve the problems in the society in the long run.
